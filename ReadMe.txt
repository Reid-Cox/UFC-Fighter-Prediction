In this paper, we conducted a multiple linear regression analysis to predict the win-loss percentage of a UFC fighter’s career. 
We wanted to determine if a researcher could reliably predict the win-loss percentage based off the fighter’s physical features,
such as their weight, height, and wingspan; and fighting techniques and performance such as their stance, striking accuracy, submissions,
etc. Using Google Colab, we conducted this analysis and tested the performance of our model using multiple popular regression performance
metrics against a testing and training dataset.
